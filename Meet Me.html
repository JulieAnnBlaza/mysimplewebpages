	<p><div style="text-indent: 60px;"><div align="justify"><font color="black" size="5" face="Segoe UI Light"><b>Hi! You can call me Julz, Juju, or Jubi. Some of my friends also call me "Maloi", probably because I’m a huge fan of the P-pop girl group 'Bini'. I am 19 years old and a first-year BSIT 1-1 student at PUP. I live at #189 B Don Fabian St., Quezon City. My birthday is on November 16, 2005, making me a Scorpio. I am also of mixed heritage, half Chinese and half Spanish. My dad is a chef who makes the best dishes, and my mom is a housewife who’s the glue that holds us all together. I’m the eldest among my two younger brothers, and as their "Ate," I’ve mastered the art of being both the boss and the one they rely on when they need help. They keep our household lively (and chaotic), but I wouldn’t have it any other way. Ever since I started school, I’ve been an honor student. I’m good at English and enjoy communicating my thoughts, though Math sometimes feels like it’s speaking in a secret code only numbers understand. Even so, I love taking on challenges, and I believe there’s always room for improvement as long as you keep trying. As an ambivert, I find balance in being social and reflective. I enjoy spending time with others and making new connections, but I also value moments of quiet where I can recharge and focus on myself. This duality helps me adapt to different situations and understand people better. In everything I do, I strive to grow and become the best version of myself. I know that life is full of ups and downs, but I face each day with a smile and a determination to learn something new. Whether it’s a personal achievement, helping someone, or just making others laugh, I find joy in the little things that make life meaningful.</font></p></b>
	<p><div style="text-indent: 60px;"><div align="justify"><font color="black" size="5" face="Segoe UI Light"><b>I am proud of the skills I’ve developed over the years, which help me excel in both academics and personal pursuits. I have strong communication skills, allowing me to express my ideas clearly and connect with others effectively. My problem-solving abilities and creativity often come in handy when faced with challenges, especially in my coursework as a BSIT student. I am also skilled in organization and time management, which enable me to balance my studies and responsibilities efficiently. While I am continually honing my technical skills, I believe my adaptability and eagerness to learn are what truly set me apart.</font></p></b>
	<p><div style="text-indent: 60px;"><div align="justify"><font color="black" size="5" face="Segoe UI Light"><b>My dream is to become a web designer or game developer. I’ve always been interested in technology, and I love the idea of creating websites or games that people can enjoy and use. I want to combine my creativity with my skills to build things that make a difference. As I continue learning, I’m focused on gaining the knowledge I need to make my dream come true and be part of this exciting field.</font></p></b>
